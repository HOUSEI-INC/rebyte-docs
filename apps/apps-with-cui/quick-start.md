# Quick Start

We will show to how to build an app using the customized UI.

Before building an app, you need to think about **what you want your app to do**. Then, think about the **input,data flow and output** of the agent this app will connect with. 

For example, if you want to build an App that can get the 7-day weather forcast for you, first think about that the user's query will be, how the agent will get the weather forcast, and how the agent should return the following 7 days' to the user(perhaps JSON format). Then, you can start building your app and agent.

## Step 1: Create an App

* Navigate to the "My Apps" tab in the sidebar and then click on "Create App" on the top right.

* Choose "App With Customized UI".

* Use the tools on the bottom of this page to draw a basic draft of your app interface.

* Click "Make It An App" on the bottom right.

* Fill in the text prompt describing what you want your app to do.

* You can then click "Draw it" or "Make It An App".


## Step 2: Design you App

If you want to make some changes to your app, you can change your app in two ways:

* Image prompt: Draw the changes you want to make on the canvas.

* Text prompt: Click the "Make It An App" and input the text prompt describing the changes you want to make.

Click "Make It An App" again and we will make changes for you based on your prompt and create a new version of your app.

* NOTE: This may not give you the desired results on just one try. We recommend you to try and improve one thing at a time and create more versions until you get the best results.

## Step 3: Connect your App with Agent

* Click the "Connect to Agent" on the top right and choose the agent you want to connect with.

* NOTE: You must be familiar with the agent's function. Make sure the agent is suitable for your app, otherwise it will not connect successfully.

* Use the prompts to describe how you want to use the agent in your app.

* Click "Make It An App" and we will automatically connect your app with the chosen agent.

## Tips

* To get better results, try describing your functions/changes you'd like to make one at a time and in details.

* Make good use of the drawing tools to tell us the changes you want to make to the current app.

* Each time you click "Make It An App", we will generate a new version of your app. If you find the results unsatifactory, simply go back to previous versions and start from there again.

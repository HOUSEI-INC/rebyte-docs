* Fill in the text prompt describing what you want your app to do.

* You can then click "Draw it" or "Make It An App".


## Step 2: Design you App

If you want to make some changes to your app, you can change your app in two ways:

* Image prompt: Draw the changes you want to make on the canvas.

* Click "Make It An App" and we will automatically connect your app with the chosen agent.

## Tips

* To get better results, try describing your functions/changes you'd like to make one at a time and in details.

* Make good use of the drawing tools to tell us the changes you want to make to the current app.

* Each time you click "Make It An App", we will generate a new version of your app. If you find the results unsatifactory, simply go back to previous versions and start from there again.

## Before you start

Before building an app, you need to think about **what you want your app to do**. Then, think about the **input,data flow and output** of the agent this app will connect with. 
# Overview


For example, if you want to build an App that can get the current weather and draw a picture descibing the weather for you. 

* First think about that the user's query will be. In this case, the input would be a city name or a sentence like "What's the weather in New York?". 
* Then, think about how the agent should get the weather information. In ReByte, we provide tools like "Google Search" or "You.com search" to help you get the information you want. Here, you can use "You.com search" to get the weather information.
* Also, think about the data the agent should send the to your app. For example, to send the weather information, should you send a plain text or JSON data?
* Finally, think about how the user interface of your app should look like: where to get the input, where to display the output and how the app should react to the user's input.
* Once you have a clear idea of what you want your app to do, you can start building your app and agent.

# Collaboration

To avoid incosistency, ReByte has provided features that allow you to work with your teams on building agents.

* If **two or more people** are on the same agent's page, we will automatically "lock" the page, which means no one can edit this agent.

* To unlock, click the "lock" icon hovering at the bottom.

# Collaboration

To avoid incosistency, ReByte has provided features that allow you to work with your teams on building agents.

If two or more people are on the same agent's editting page, we will automatically clock the page.

If you want to modify the agent like adding a new action or changing the model's instructions, click the "lock" on the bottom of the page to unlock.

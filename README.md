# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to ReByte

## The era of end user programming 

The emergence of LLM in the software industry will bring about a monumental transformation.
Soon all normal computer users will have the ability to develop small software tools from scratch, and to describe modifications theyâ€™d like made to software theyâ€™re already using.

**ReByte** is built with one mission in mind: to empower end users to create their own AI tools without the need for a data science or engineering background.&#x20;

Also, **ReByte** is built to solve following problems:

1. **Iterative Nature of LLM Development**: Create tool on top of modern LLM models can be quite a challenge process, due to the nature of LLM models. LLM outputs are not deterministic, and the model performance can vary from time to time. We want to make sure that the tooling is ready for this.
2. **Painless Private Data integration**: Today's LLM tools  heavily rely on data. We want to make sure that the data integration process is as painless as possible.
3  **Production Serving Ready**: Provide a robust environment ready for immediate deployment and scalable growth.

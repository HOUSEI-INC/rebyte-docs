# A Guide to 4 Key RAG Techniques

Welcome to our comprehensive overview of query translation techniques in Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. In this series, we've explored four innovative methods revolutionizing user query processing. These are Multi-Query Translation, RAG Fusion, Decomposition, and Step-Back Prompting. We'll demonstrate how these techniques can be implemented in ReByte, complete with agent and app examples.

## 1. Multi-Query Translation

Multi-Query Translation diversifies a user's query by rephrasing it into various forms. In ReByte, this is achieved using the "LLM-chat" action to generate multiple queries from a single user question. 

Here's the prompt for the LLM.

And the LLM generates three sub-queries.

This technique enhances the likelihood of retrieving relevant information, as each query version might align differently with the documents in the database.

For implementation, we use "Map-Reduce" and "Knowledge Search" actions to retrieve information for each query, followed by another "LLM-chat" action to summarize the results.

## 2. RAG Fusion

RAG Fusion, an extension of Multi-Query Translation, includes a crucial reciprocal rank fusion step. This method consolidates results from multiple queries into a single, optimized list, making it ideal for comprehensive information retrieval.

Here's the prompt for the LLM.

And the LLM generates three sub-queries.

RAG Fusion is demonstrated in ReByte through a similar process of generating multiple queries and retrieving documents.

## 3. Decomposition

Decomposition addresses complex queries by breaking them into smaller sub-questions, each solved independently. This approach, demonstrated in ReByte, simplifies the retrieval process and allows for detailed responses.

Here's the prompt for the LLM.

And the LLM generates three sub-queries.

Here, the "LLM-chat" action is used to generate sub-queries, which are then rocessed to form a comprehensive answer.

## 4. Step-Back Prompting

Step-Back Prompting abstracts a specific query into a more general one, broadening the scope of information retrieval. In ReByte, this method generates high-level questions from specific queries, facilitating the retrieval of a wider range of related information.

Here's the prompt for the LLM.

<figure><img src="../images/step-back-1.png" alt=""></figure>

And the LLM generates three more general query.

This technique is particularly effective in contexts where background information is as crucial as the query's specific details.

## Conclusion

These query translation techniques form a robust toolkit in RAG systems, ensuring accurate, relevant, and comprehensive information retrieval. Multi-Query Translation and RAG Fusion expand search scope, Decomposition simplifies complex queries, and Step-Back Prompting elevates queries to a more abstract level. Stay tuned for further insights and advancements in query translation and RAG pipelines.

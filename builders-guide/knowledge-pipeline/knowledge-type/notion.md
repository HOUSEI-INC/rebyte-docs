# Notion

The Notion integration allows users to seamlessly connect their Notion workspaces. By logging in with your Notion account and selecting the workspace you want to connect, we will automatically sync the Notion pages you select. The knowledge base is fully hosted, meaning any changes made in Notion will be dynamically updated into the knowledge base.

## Create an Agent

To build an agent, fisrt you should create a new agent by clicking the `Create Agent` button and create a `Stack Agent`.

When creating a `Stack Agent`, we will first ask you to describe what you want to build in a few words or sentences. We also provide several agent templates to make the building process easier.

Then you can click the `Generate Agent Template` button, and we will generate a basic template for you to build from. You can change the name, description and  visibility of the agent and add tags for more information. Or you can simply regenerate the template if you think the current template is not good.

Once you are done with this part, click the `Create Agent` at the buttom of this page and you will have your own agent in seconds.

## Build your Agent

Now that we have an agent, you can build your agents' functions with the `Actions` in the agent.

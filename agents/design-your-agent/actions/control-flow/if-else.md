# If Else

This action will run the actions if some condition is met. 

The condition is a Javascript code that returns a boolean value. 

The code can reference the output of previous actions by using the `env.state.ACTION_NAME` syntax. 

For example, if the previous action is named `ACTION_1`, then the code can reference the output of `ACTION_1` by using `env.state.ACTION_1`.

# Quick Start

* Click the "Generate Agent Template" button and we will generate a basic template for you to build from. 

* You can change the name, description and visibility of the agent and add tags for more information. Or you can simply regenerate the template if you think the current template is not good.

* Click the "Create Agent" and you will have your own agent in just a few seconds.

## Step 2: Design Your Agent

* In the basic template, we have already created some actions for you. 

* To build a grammar mistake correction agent, there's no need for adding more actions. But for more complex agents, you add actions by clicking the plus button between different actions.

* Write the instructions in the editor and tell the model what to do.

## Step 3: Test Your Agent

* Click the "Datasets" tab, then click "Create Datasets". Fill in the name and description of the dataset.

* Since this is a chatbot, the testing dataset will be in the form of a list of json object representing a conversation.

<!-- ## Document

Each knowledge contains a list of documents, each document is identified by a unique document id within the knowledge.

## Chunk

Document will be chunked into multiple chunks, each chunk is identified by a unique chunk id within the document. Chunk will be sent to LLM embedding service to get the embedding vector.
When creating knowledge, user can specify the chunk size, which will determine how many chunks a document will be chunked into. Typical chunk size could be ranging from a few hundred tokens to a few thousand tokens. -->

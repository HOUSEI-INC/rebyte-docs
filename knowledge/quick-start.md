# Quick Start

Here we tell you now to create and use knowledge.

## Step 1: Create Knowledge

* Navigate to the "Knowledge" tab in the sidebar and then click "Create Knowledge".

* Fill in the knowledge information and choose the source type for your knowledge. Here we choose "Self Managed" since we are going to use local files.

## Step 2: Upload Files

* Click "Upload File" and upload your local file. 

* Once uploaded, we will generate a unique document id for your file.

* Click "Insert Document" to upload this file.
